## thing-emotion affinity

One [day](day.md), [calpoop](index.md) realized that a [thing](thing.md) and an [emotion](emotion.md) might be [deeply](depth.md) related, even to the point of [oneness](one.md).

Imagine that every single [thing](thing.md) you see is also an [emotion](emotion.md).

> "I have all these things for you."  

takes on another [level](level.md)

[Fire](fire.md) may also have a relationship with [earth](earth.md) like this.

Is earth solidified fire? Is a thing a solidified emotion? Is it all fire? Is it all earth?

Is it both? Should it be both?
